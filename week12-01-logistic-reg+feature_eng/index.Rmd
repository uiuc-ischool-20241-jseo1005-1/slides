## Spam filters

.pull-left-narrow[
- Data from 3921 emails and 21 variables on them
- Outcome: whether the email is spam or not
- Predictors: number of characters, whether the email had "Re:" in the subject, time at which email was sent, number of times the word "inherit" shows up in the email, etc.
]

.question[
Would you expect longer or shorter emails to be spam?
]

.question[
Would you expect emails that have subjects starting with "Re:", "RE:", "re:", or "rE:" to be spam or not?
]

--

```{r echo=FALSE}

  ggplot(aes(x = re_subj, fill = spam)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(
    x = 'Whether “re:”, "RE:", etc. was in the email subject.',

    y = NULL,
    title = 'Spam vs. "re:" in subject'
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#DEB4A0", "#CA235F"))
```

---

## Modeling spam

- Both number of characters and whether the message has "re:" in the subject might be related to whether the email is spam. How do we come up with a model that will let us explore this relationship?

--
- For simplicity, we'll focus on the number of characters (`num_char`) as predictor, but the model we describe can be expanded to take multiple predictors as well.

---

## Modeling spam

This isn't something we can reasonably fit a linear model to -- we need something different!

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
means <- email %>%
  group_by(spam) %>%
  summarise(mean_num_char = mean(num_char)) %>%
  mutate(group = 1)

ggplot(email, aes(x = num_char, y = spam, color = spam))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(data = means, aes(x = mean_num_char, y = spam, group = group), color = "black", size = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Number of characters (in thousands)", y = "Spam") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#DEB4A0", "#CA235F")) 
```


---

## Framing the problem

- In linear model 
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_k X_k$$
We know,
  - outcome is continuous
  - outcome range is not bounded
  
 
- In our present case, we have a binary outcome: $Y \in$ {0,1} 

---
## Framing the problem: 

Strategy to model $Y$:
  - Treat each outcome $y_i$ (spam and not) as successes and failures arising from separate Bernoulli trials

      - Bernoulli trial: a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes, "success" and "failure", in which the probability of success is the same every time the experiment is conducted
      - Each Bernoulli trial can have a separate probability of success

$$ y_i ∼ Bern(p_i) $$
---
## Framing the problem: 

Strategy to model $Y$:
  - Model success probability using predictors
     - Transformation of linear model to produce outcomes b/w 0 & 1
$$ P(Y=1|X=x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k)}}$$
 In matrix notation,
$$ P(Y=1|X=x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x^T\beta}}$$

# Logistic regression

---

## Logistic regression

- Logistic regression is an extension of Linear Model to situations where the outcome variable is categorical

- In Logistic regression, we perform non-linear transformation of the linear regression equation to produce numbers between 0&1

- Logistic regression is a **Generalized Linear Models(GLM)** where the relationship between response and predictors is still represented using a linear function of $x$, $x^Tβ$.

---

## Generalized linear models

- This is a very general way of addressing many problems in regression and the resulting models are called **generalized linear models (GLMs)**

--
- Logistic regression is just one example

---

## Three characteristics of GLMs

All GLMs have the following three characteristics:

1. A probability distribution describing a generative model for the outcome variable

--
2. A linear model:
$$\eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_k X_k$$

--
3. A link function that relates  to the parameter of the outcome distribution

---


## The logistic regression model

- Based on the three GLM criteria we have
  - $y_i \sim \text{Bern}(p_i)$
  
  - $\eta_i = \beta_0+\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_n x_{n,i}$
  - Need to find a function that relates the linear model, $\eta_i$, to the parameter of the outcome distribution, $p_i$. 

---

## Interpretation of  paramaters

- We know that,

$$ P(Y=1|X=x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x^T\beta}}$$
--
Hence, 
$$ P(Y=0|X=x) = 1 - P(Y=1|X=x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{x^T\beta}}$$

--
Odds are defined as the probability that the event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur.

 $$ Odds (of success)= \frac{P(Y=1|X=x)}{P(Y=0|X=x)} = e^{x^T\beta}$$


---
## Interpretation of paramaters

$$ Odds = \frac{P(Y=1|X=x)}{P(Y=0|X=x)} = \frac{p}{1-p} =e^{x^T\beta}$$
--
  Taking log on both sides:
$$ log(Odds) = log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = {x^T\beta}$$
--
  Log of odds is also known as logits
$$ logit(p) = log(\frac{p}{1-p})$$

---

## Logit function, visualized

```{r echo=FALSE}
d <- tibble(p = seq(0.001, 0.999, length.out = 1000)) %>%
  mutate(logit_p = log(p / (1 - p)))

ggplot(d, aes(x = p, y = logit_p)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ylab("logit(p)") +
  labs(title = "logit(p) vs. p")
```

---

## Properties of the logit

- The logit function takes a value between 0 and 1 and maps it to a value between $-\infty$ and $\infty$
$$logit(p) = x^T \beta$$

--
- Inverse logit (logistic) function:
$$logit^{-1}(p) = p$$
$$logit^{-1}(\frac{1}{1+e^{-x^T\beta}}) = p$$

--
- The inverse logit function takes a value between $-\infty$ and $\infty$ and maps it to a value between 0 and 1

--
- This formulation is also useful for interpreting the model, since the logit can be interpreted as the log odds of a success -- more on this later


---

## Modeling spam

In R we fit a GLM in the same way as a linear model except we

- specify the model with `logistic_reg()`
- use `"glm"` instead of `"lm"` as the engine 
- define `family = "binomial"` for the link function to be used in the model

--

```{r}
spam_fit <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(spam ~ num_char, data = email, family = "binomial")

tidy(spam_fit)
```

---

## Spam model

```{r}
tidy(spam_fit)
```

--

Model:
$$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = -1.80-0.0621\times \text{num_char}$$

---

## P(spam) for an email with 2000 characters 

$$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = -1.80-0.0621\times 2$$
--
$$\frac{p}{1-p} = \exp(-1.9242) = 0.15 \rightarrow p = 0.15 \times (1 - p)$$
--
$$p = 0.15 - 0.15p \rightarrow 1.15p = 0.15$$
--
$$p = 0.15 / 1.15 = 0.13$$

---

# Prediction

---

## Goal: Building a spam filter

- Data: Set of emails and we know if each email is spam/not and other features 
- Use logistic regression to predict the probability that an incoming email is spam
- Use model selection to pick the model with the best predictive performance

--
- Building a model to predict the probability that an email is spam is only half of the battle! We also need a decision rule about which emails get flagged as spam (e.g. what probability should we use as out cutoff?)

--
- A simple approach: choose a single threshold probability and any email that exceeds that probability is flagged as spam

---

## A multiple regression approach

.small[
```{r ref.label = "spam-mlr", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(spam ~ ., data = email, family = "binomial") %>%
  tidy() %>%
  print(n = 22)
```
]
]

---

## Prediction

- The mechanics of prediction is **easy**:
  - Plug in values of predictors to the model equation
  - Calculate the predicted value of the response variable, $\hat{y}$

--
- Getting it right is **hard**!
  - There is no guarantee the model estimates you have are correct
  - Or that your model will perform as well with new data as it did with your sample data

---

## Underfitting and overfitting

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", warning = FALSE}
lm_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(y4 ~ x2, data = association)

loess_fit <- loess(y4 ~ x2, data = association)

loess_overfit <- loess(y4 ~ x2, span = 0.05, data = association)

association %>%
  select(x2, y4) %>%
  mutate(
    Underfit = augment(lm_fit$fit) %>% select(.fitted) %>% pull(),
    OK       = augment(loess_fit) %>% select(.fitted) %>% pull(),
    Overfit  = augment(loess_overfit) %>% select(.fitted) %>% pull(),
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols      = Underfit:Overfit,
    names_to  = "fit",
    values_to = "y_hat"
  ) %>%
  mutate(fit = fct_relevel(fit, "Underfit", "OK", "Overfit")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x2)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = y4), color = "darkgray") +
  geom_line(aes(y = y_hat, group = fit, color = fit), size = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, color = NULL) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma", end = 0.7)
```

---

## Spending our data

- Several steps to create a useful model: parameter estimation, model selection, performance assessment, etc.

- Doing all of this on the entire data we have available can lead to **overfitting**

- Allocate specific subsets of data for different tasks, as opposed to allocating the largest possible amount to the model parameter estimation only (which is what we've done so far)

# Splitting data

---

## Splitting data

- **Training set:**
  - Sandbox for model building 
  - Spend most of your time using the training set to develop the model
  - Majority of the data (usually 80%)
  
- **Testing set:**
  - Held in reserve to determine efficacy of one or two chosen models
  - Critical to look at it once, otherwise it becomes part of the modeling process
  - Remainder of the data (usually 20%)

## Performing the split

```{r}
# Fix random numbers by setting the seed
# Enables analysis to be reproducible when random numbers are used

# Feature engineering

---

## Feature engineering

- We prefer simple models when possible, but **parsimony** does not mean sacrificing accuracy (or predictive performance) in the interest of simplicity

--
- Variables that go into the model and how they are represented are just as critical to success of the model

--
- **Feature engineering** allows us to get creative with our predictors in an effort to make them more useful for our model (to increase its predictive performance) 

---

## Same training and testing sets as before

```{r}
# Fix random numbers by setting the seed
# Enables analysis to be reproducible when random numbers are used
set.seed(1116)

# Put 80% of the data into the training set
email_split <- initial_split(email, prop = 0.80)

# Create data frames for the two sets:
train_data <- training(email_split)
test_data <- testing(email_split)
```

---

## A simple approach: `mutate()`

```{r}
train_data %>%
  mutate(
    date = date(time),
    dow = wday(time),
    month = month(time)
  ) %>%
  select(time, date, dow, month) %>%
  sample_n(size = 5) # shuffle to show a variety
```

---

## Modeling workflow, revisited

- Create a **recipe** for feature engineering steps to be applied to the training data

--
- **Fit the model** to the training data after these steps have been applied

--
- Using the model estimates from the training data, **predict outcomes** for the test data

--
- **Evaluate the model performance** on the test data

# Building workflows

## Define model

```{r}
email_mod <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm")

email_mod
```

---

## Define workflow

**Workflows** bring together models and recipes so that they can be easily applied to both the training and test data.

```{r}
email_wflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(email_mod) %>%
  add_recipe(email_rec)
```

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_wflow
```
]

---

## Fit model to training data

```{r}
email_fit <- email_wflow %>%
  fit(data = train_data)
```

---

.small[
```{r}
tidy(email_fit) %>% print(n = 31)
```
]

---

## Make predictions for test data

```{r}
email_pred <- predict(email_fit, test_data, type = "prob") %>%
  bind_cols(test_data)

email_pred
```

---

## Evaluate the performance

.pull-left[
```{r roc2, fig.show="hide"}
email_pred %>%
  roc_curve(
    truth = spam,
    .pred_1,
    event_level = "second"
  ) %>%
  autoplot()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="roc", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
```
]

---

## Evaluate the performance

.pull-left[
```{r}
email_pred %>%
  roc_auc(
    truth = spam,
    .pred_1,
    event_level = "second"
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="roc", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
