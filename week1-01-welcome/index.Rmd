## Data science

.pull-left-wide[
- Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. 

- We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.
]

---

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - Can I take this course?**  
A - (Maybe) No. It is highly recommended that you do not take this course if you have taken STATS 207 and/or CS307.  
A - (Maybe) Yes, if you had only taken STATS107 and/or STATS200.
]

---

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
  **Q - What data science background does this course assume?**  
A - Foundational understanding of programming (variables, for-loops, functions & flow control) is assumed for this course. If you have little or no programming background, you are highly recommended to have taken an introductory programming course (e.g. IS205 or IS430).
]

---

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
  **Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - While statistics $\ne$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.
]

---

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**  
A - No, but many themes are shared.

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**  
A - R.

**Q: Why not language X?**  
A: We can discuss that over `r emo::ji("coffee")`.

## Reproducibility checklist

.question[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

Near-term goals:

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? 

Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

---

## Toolkit for reproducibility

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
- Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown
- Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

## Git and GitHub

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
#| fig-alt: git logo
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-logo.png")

- Git is a version control system -- like ‚ÄúTrack Changes‚Äù features from Microsoft Word, on steroids
- It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one
]
.pull-right[

- We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration (and as our course management system!)

# Git and GitHub tips

- There are millions of git commands -- ok, that's an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them -- and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

--
- We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio, but if you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.

--
- There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/). Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.

---

## Tour: Git and GitHub

- Create a GitHub account
- Verify your GitHub email
- Adjust your GitHub settings for a more pleasant GitHub experience

## R and RStudio

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
#| fig-alt: R logo
knitr::include_graphics("img/r-logo.png")
```
- R is an open-source statistical **programming language**
- R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics
- It's easily extensible with *packages*
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
#| fig-alt: RStudio logo
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-logo.png")
```
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *"I write R code in the RStudio IDE"*
- RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists
]

---

## R packages

- **Packages** are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data<sup>1</sup>

There are over 16,000 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)<sup>2</sup>

- We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these!

<sup>2</sup> [CRAN contributed packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/).

## Tour: R and RStudio

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
#| fig-alt: R and RStudio demo screenshot
knitr::include_graphics("img/tour-r-rstudio.png")
```

---

## A short list (for now) of R essentials

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
verb(object)
eat(food) #<<
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

---

## R essentials (continued)

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

.small[
```{r eval=FALSE}
dataframe$var_name
```
]

--

- Object documentation can be accessed with `?`

```{r eval=FALSE}
?mean
```

---

## tidyverse

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="99%"}
#| fig-alt: tidyverse logo
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidyverse.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
.center[.large[
[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
]]

- The **tidyverse** is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar
]

---

## rmarkdown

.pull-left[
.center[.large[
[rmarkdown.rstudio.com](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
]]

- **rmarkdown** and the various packages that support it enable R users to write their code and prose in reproducible computational documents
- We will generally refer to R Markdown documents (with `.Rmd` extension), e.g. *"Do this in your R Markdown document"* and rarely discuss loading the rmarkdown package

## R Markdown

- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning
- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Every assignment / report / project / etc. is an R Markdown document
- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
