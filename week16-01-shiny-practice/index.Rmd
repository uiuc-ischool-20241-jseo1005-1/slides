## Shiny

.pull-left[
- Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R
- You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards
- You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions
- Learn more at [shiny.rstudio.com](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

## High level view

- Every Shiny app has a webpage that the user visits, and behind this webpage there is a computer that serves this webpage by running R

- When running your app locally, the computer serving your app is your computer

- When your app is deployed, the computer serving your app is a web server

## Source code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load
library(shiny)

# Front-end user interface
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("JooYoung's Shiny"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      "Sidebar Panel",
      numericInput(inputId = "num", "Type any integer:", value = 50),
      selectInput(inputId = "color", "Choose your color for histogram:", choices = colors(), selected = "blue")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      "Main panel",
      plotOutput(outputId = "histogram")
    )
  )
)

# Back-end logic
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  num <- reactive(input$num)

  color <- reactive(input$color)
  output$histogram <- renderPlot(hist(rnorm(num()), col = color()))
}

# Execute
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
